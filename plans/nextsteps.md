I've completed a comprehensive architecture and visual plan for "My Mobile Trainer"!

📦 What I've Delivered
I've created three detailed planning documents in the /plans directory:

1. my-mobile-trainer-architecture.md
Complete technical architecture covering:

Technology stack (React Native + Expo + TypeScript)
System architecture with Mermaid diagrams
Data model and database schema
Formula implementation strategy from your Excel logic
Development phases and roadmap
Risk assessment and mitigation
Testing strategy
2. ui-mockups-visual-guide.md
Visual mockups for 14+ screens including:

Onboarding flow (welcome, profile, body weight)
Main dashboard with stats and quick actions
Active workout interface with set logging
Rest timer screen
Exercise video modal
Workout summary and achievements
Progress dashboard with charts
Personal records tracking
Profile and settings screens
Dark mode variations
3. architecture-summary-visual.md
Executive summary with:

Visual architecture diagrams
Data flow sequences
Formula logic examples
Priority matrix for features
Quick reference guides
🎯 Key Architectural Decisions
Platform: React Native + Expo for iOS and Android

Database: WatermelonDB (local-first, offline-capable)

State: Redux Toolkit

Strategy: MVP focused, local-only with cloud backup in Phase 2

🧮 Formula Engine Highlights
The app will replicate your Excel logic:

Week-based percentages: Different intensity levels per week
Progressive overload: Auto-adjust weights based on rep performance
Accessory exercise ratios: Calculate based on primary lift maxes
Smart rounding: Round to gym-available weights (2.5, 5, 10 lb increments)
📋 Implementation Checklist
I've created a 42-item todo list covering:

Project setup and configuration
Core services (Formula Calculator, Workout Engine)
Database and state management
All UI screens and components
Testing and validation
App store deployment
🤔 Questions for You
Is this architecture plan aligned with your vision? Specifically:

Does the React Native + Expo approach work for you?
Is the local-first, offline-capable strategy right for the MVP?
Are the UI mockups capturing the experience you want?
Should I adjust any feature priorities in the todo list?
Do you want to add or modify anything in the formula logic?
Are there any specific design preferences or branding requirements?
The plan is ready to move into implementation once you're satisfied with it!

I've created a comprehensive architecture plan with visual diagrams for your "My Mobile Trainer" app, including 3 detailed planning documents covering technical architecture, UI mockups for 14+ screens, and implementation strategy. The plan uses React Native + Expo for iOS/Android with formula-driven weight calculations matching your Excel logic. Are you satisfied with this plan, or would you like me to adjust anything before we proceed to implementation?

Next steps;

This looks great lets proceed to implementation in code mode

Good but id like to make some changes to the architecture first

can you add more detail about the formula calculations from the excel

i want to review the documents first before deciding
